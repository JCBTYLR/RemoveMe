			<p>	Getting calls from phone numbers that look like yours but aren't loaded into your contacts might make you feel the urge to answer. Maybe your friend who dropped their phone in the pool was forced to get a new number? Maybe someone in your town is calling with unexpected news? Seeing that familiar area code will tempt you more than "UNKNOWN" scripted across your screen or an out of town number — those, you're more likely to send to voicemail.</p>

			<p>	However, the calls are actually spam, and the mimicking of your number was more than intentional.</p>

			<p>	That ~something~ on the other end of the phone is privy to your screening activity. Imitating your phone number is a sure-er way to get you to say, "hello?". And most of the time, it's just a robot. Saying you won something. But, probably, you aren't so lucky.</p>
			</div>

			<ul class="tips-list">
				
				<li>Avoid answering calls from phone numbers you don’t recognize, even if they appear to be local. If it’s 	important, the caller will leave a message.</li>

				<li>If your own phone number is used in a caller ID spoof call, you may receive calls and messages from people asking why you called them in the first place. This can lead to a lot of confusion between the two parties, but knowing your own number can be used by scammers may help explain the situation.</li>

				<li>Be aware that phone numbers of local businesses, including doctor’s offices and/or insurance agents, may appear to be calling you. If you’re not certain whether the call is legitimate or a spoof, hang up and dial the known phone number for the contact to verify the communication, especially if personal and/or financial information is being requested.</li>

				<li>Make sure your phone number is on the National Do Not Call Registry. Though it is unlikely to prevent most phone scam calls, it will help to reduce calls received from legitimate telemarketers, which can be helpful in screening fraudulent calls.</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="about-p2">
			<p>	Beyond creating an annoying intrusion, some scammers get what they want if they reach unsuspecting individuals: Your money. By calling some who may not realize it's a scam and lying about there being some need for you to hand over your bank account details or credit card digits, people are being duped out of their cash.</p>

			<p>	Unfortunately, when the number comes from a trusted and familiar area code, it's easier for the robocaller to get what they want. A number of scams target specific demographics: "Grandparent scams" pinpoint senior citizens, asking for money and sometimes succeed at robbing grandparents bank accounts by posing as a family member. In one particular case, according to New York State's Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, a 82 year old grandmother lost $32,000 from a scam.</p>

			<p>	The losses of both your time and finances can be critical. While a call from a number similar to your own might be tempting to pick up, it's probably not worth answering. Send that baby to voicemail and screen all unknown calls before dealing with any robotic voices.</p>
